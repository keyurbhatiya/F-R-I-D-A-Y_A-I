# Friday - My Python Automation Project

This project leverages several Python libraries to perform a variety of tasks, including web automation, speech recognition, and network speed testing.

## Features

- **Datetime and Time Operations**: Uses `datetime` and `time` modules for time-based functions.
- **File and OS Operations**: Uses `os` module for interacting with the operating system.
- **Randomization**: Uses `random` module for generating random values.
- **Web Automation and Browsing**: Utilizes `webbrowser` and `pyautogui` for automating web tasks.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses `pyttsx3` for converting text to speech.
- **WhatsApp Automation**: Uses `pywhatkit` for sending WhatsApp messages.
- **HTTP Requests**: Uses `requests` for making HTTP requests.
- **Clipboard Operations**: Uses `pyperclip` for clipboard operations.
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` for recognizing speech input.
- **Network Speed Testing**: Uses `speedtest` for testing network speed.
- **Web Scraping**: Uses `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for web scraping.
- **Notifications**: Uses `plyer` for sending system notifications.
- **Audio Playback**: Uses `pygame.mixer` for playing audio files.
