The name "Ram" can refer to several things, depending on the context. Here are some of the most common interpretations:

* **Rama:** In Hinduism, Rama is a major deity, considered the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu. He is the central figure of the epic poem Ramayana, which tells the story of his life, his marriage to Sita, his exile from his kingdom, and his eventual victory over the demon king Ravana. Rama is widely worshipped as an embodiment of virtue, righteousness, and devotion.

* **A common Indian name:** Ram is also a common first name for both men and women in India. It can be short for a longer name, such as Ramachandra or Ramnath, or it can stand alone.

Without more context, it is impossible to say for sure which "Ram" you are referring to. If you can provide more information, I may be able to give you a more specific answer.
